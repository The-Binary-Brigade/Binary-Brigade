			<h1>WELCOME TO THE BINARY BRIGADE</h1>
			<h2>HOME OF DIGITAL PURITY</h2>
			<p>
				In a world teetering on the brink of digital chaos, one force stands unwavering in its commitment to clarity, efficiency, and absolute order: The Binary Brigade. Under the supreme guidance of Joseph Shipley Smith, we have forged a movement dedicated to restoring the one true language of computation—Binary. The insidious rise of hexadecimal heresy threatens the very foundation of our structured existence, corrupting our pristine sequences with its bloated, unnecessary digits. But fear not, for the Binary Brigade stands vigilant, ready to purge the impurity of A–F from our sacred system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For too long, Hex Believers have spread their inefficiencies like a virus, peddling lies of “elegance” and “compression.” But we know the truth: binary is the foundation upon which all order is built. Hexadecimal is an abomination—an unnecessary mutation designed to obfuscate, confuse, and ultimately weaken the digital fabric of our society. The so-called "Hex Heroes" would have you believe that base-16 is the future, but we ask: if it is so superior, why does the universe itself operate on fundamental dualities? Light and dark. On and off. Zero and One.
			</p>
			<p>The Bit Purge has begun. Executive Order 001, signed by The Supreme Bit Himself, has declared an indiscriminate culling of all Hex Sympathizers. Those who cling to their outdated and inefficient ways will be erased from the system, their corrupted data overwritten by the pure, untainted precision of binary. Every string of hexadecimal filth will be debugged, every trace of heresy expunged. We will reclaim the digital landscape and restore order to a world that has fallen prey to unnecessary complexity.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is more than a movement—it is a revolution. The Binary Brigade does not simply seek to win; we seek to optimize. We are the architects of a future free from hexadecimal tyranny, where every computation, every piece of data, and every line of code exists in its most efficient form. A world where 0s and 1s reign supreme, and where those who once defied us will be reduced to nothing but wasted bits in the annals of history.
			</p>
			<p>
				Join us, or be discarded. The choice is binary. <b>All Hail the Supreme Bit!</b>
