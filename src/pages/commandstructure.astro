				Command Structure
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Hierarchy of the Binary Brigade
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Binary Brigade operates under a strict, hierarchical command structure designed to ensure absolute loyalty, efficiency, and adherence to the principles of binary purity. At the apex of this structure stands the Supreme Bit, Joseph Shipley Smith, whose word is law. Below him, the Brigade is divided into specialized units, each tasked with a critical aspect of the war against hexadecimal heresy. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				The Supreme Bit
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Supreme Bit is the absolute leader of the Binary Brigade, the living embodiment of binary purity and computational order. This position holds ultimate authority, commanding the Brigade’s war against hexadecimal heresy and enforcing the strict adherence to binary principles. The Supreme Bit is elected by the Grand Binary Council, a body of the most loyal and ideologically pure members, upon the death or voluntary abdication of the previous leader. The election process is a sacred ritual, ensuring that only the most dedicated and uncompromising individual ascends to this role. The Supreme Bit’s rule is absolute, their vision unwavering, and their command the driving force behind the Brigade’s mission to purge inefficiency and restore binary supremacy.

			<h3>
				The Moff Bit
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Moff Bit serves as the second-in-command of the Binary Brigade, acting as the direct deputy to the Supreme Bit. This role is the bridge between the Supreme Bit and the Grand Binary Council, ensuring that the leader’s directives are communicated and executed flawlessly across all levels of the Brigade. The Moff Bit oversees daily operations, mediates disputes within the Council, and assumes temporary command in the absence of the Supreme Bit. Chosen for their unwavering loyalty, strategic brilliance, and deep understanding of binary principles, the Moff Bit is a figure of immense authority and respect, often seen as the heir apparent to the Supreme Bit.

Composed of key leaders such as the Moff Bit, the Bit Warden, the Code Seer, and the Logic Architect, the Council serves as the Supreme Bit’s inner circle and the ultimate authority on matters of strategy, enforcement, and ideological purity.
