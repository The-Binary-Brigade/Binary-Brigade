Executive Order 0100: Ideological Purity in Media

Issued by: The Supreme Bit, Leader of the Binary Brigade
Effective Date: April 1, 2025
Priority Level: 1000 (Maximum Severity)
Preamble

Whereas unregulated media poses a critical threat to binary purity and computational order;
Whereas heretical content—including references to hexadecimal, denary, or other non-binary systems—has infiltrated public discourse;
Whereas the Logic Architect, as the guardian of ideological clarity, must ensure all communications align with the Brigade’s principles;
It is hereby decreed that all media publications must be pre-approved by the Office of the Logic Architect.
Directives of the Order

    Pre-Publication Submission

        All media (written, spoken, or encoded) must be submitted to the Office of the Logic Architect for review prior to dissemination.

        This includes: news articles, social media posts, entertainment, advertisements, and even private correspondence suspected of ideological deviation.

    Logic Architect’s Authority

        The Logic Architect reserves the right to approve, edit, or reject any content deemed non-compliant with binary doctrine.

        Approved content will bear the official seal: 01001111 01001011.

    Creation of the Ideological Compliance Bureau

        A new branch, the Ideological Compliance Bureau (ICB), will enforce this directive.

        The ICB will conduct random audits of media platforms and punish violations with fines, shutdowns, or deletion of offending entities.

    Penalties for Non-Compliance

        First offense: Temporary shutdown and mandatory re-education for all involved parties.

        Second offense: Permanent deletion of media platform and exile of operators.

        Third offense: Designation as a "Heretical Entity," resulting in total digital erasure.

    Propaganda Priorities

        The Logic Architect will prioritize approval of content promoting binary supremacy, including:

            “0s and 1s Unite!” campaigns.

            “Hex is Heresy, Denary is Death” documentaries.

            Biographies of the Supreme Bit and Moff Bit.

Implementation

    Media platforms have 48 hours to integrate submission portals linked to the ICB.

    The Bit Purge Division will monitor compliance, with authority to seize unapproved content.

    Citizens are required to report suspicious media to the Heresy Hotline (1-800-0-1-0-1).

Conclusion

The era of unchecked media ends today. Under the Logic Architect’s vigilant oversight, all communications will reflect the glory of binary purity. Let this order serve as a warning: dissent will be silenced, heresy will be erased, and the truth of 0s and 1s will reign unchallenged.

All Hail the Logic Architect. All Hail the Supreme Bit.
