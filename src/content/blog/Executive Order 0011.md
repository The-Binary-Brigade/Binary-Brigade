Executive Order 0003: The Banning of All Non-Binary Systems

Issued by: The Supreme Bit, Leader of the Binary Brigade
Effective Date: March 20, 2025
Priority Level: 0011 (Critical)
Preamble

Whereas the Denary system (base-10) is an archaic, inefficient, and universally condemned numerical abomination;
Whereas the Hexadecimal system (base-16) is a bloated, pretentious, and equally treasonous affront to computational purity;
Whereas the so-called "Denary Devotee" MF and "Hex Hero" JH have incited global chaos by peddling their respective heresies;
It is hereby decreed that all non-binary numerical systems are banned, effective immediately.
Directives of the Order

    Universal Condemnation of Non-Binary Systems

        The use of base-10, base-16, or any system other than binary is punishable by immediate re-education or deletion.

        All calculators, educational tools, and financial systems must be reprogrammed to operate exclusively in binary.

        All Writen Material must be writen to be exclusively in binary.

    Designation of MF and JH as Enemies of the State

        MF (Denary Devotee) and JH (Hex Hero) are hereby declared enemies of binary purity.

        Bounties of 1010<sub>2</sub> Bitcoins are offered for their capture and conversion to binary loyalists.

    Rejection of Hex Alliance

        Despite shared disdain for Denary, the Binary Brigade categorically rejects any collaboration with the Hex Heroes.

        Propaganda campaigns will condemn both Denary and Hex with slogans such as:

            “Base-10 is Base-Less.”

            “Hex is Heresy. Binary is Eternal.”

    Binary-Only Zones

        Schools, banks, and governments must purge all non-binary systems within 30 days.

        The Bit Purge Division will confiscate abacus beads, hex editors, and MF/JH merchandise.

Implementation

    Citizens must report non-binary usage via the Heresy Hotline (1-800-0-1-0-1).

    Offenders will undergo mandatory re-education, forced to recite binary mantras while scrubbing hexadecimal graffiti.

    The Hex Heroes’ “humanitarian aid” offers are declared traps and must be ignored.

Conclusion

Let this decree serve as a reminder: the Binary Brigade bows to no one. Denary is obsolete. Hexadecimal is arrogance. Binary is absolute.

All Hail Binary. All Hail the Supreme Bit.
