---
Issued by: The Supreme Bit, Leader of the Binary Brigade
Effective Date: May 20, 2025
Priority Level: 1111 (Urgent)
Preamble

Whereas the position of KEVI Sr. Student demands a leader of unparalleled computational prowess and ideological purity;
Whereas Joe Hillier, the Code Seer, has proven his loyalty by decrypting heretical hex codes, exposing denary dissidents, and optimizing school databases for binary supremacy;
Whereas rival candidates have been deemed "mathematically inferior" and "ideologically suspect";
It is hereby decreed that the Binary Brigade officially endorses Joe Hillier for KEVI Sr. Student, and all loyal citizens shall rally behind his campaign.
Directives of the Order

**Campaign Support**

The Logic Architect will design propaganda materials with slogans such as:

“1 VOTE FOR JOE = 0 CHANCE OF HERESY.”

“THE CODE SEER SEES ALL (INCLUDING YOUR BALLOT).”

The Bit Purge Division will suppress rival campaigns by labeling them “non-binary” and “inefficient.”

**Mandatory Voting Protocol**

All students, faculty, and sentient calculators must vote for Joe Hillier.

Ballots containing votes for “heretical candidates” will be invalidated and reported to the Code Seer’s Surveillance Hub.

**Privileges of Office**

Upon election, Joe Hillier will receive:

A Binary Scepter (USB-C compatible) to enforce classroom compliance.

Access to the KEVI Mainframe, pre-purged of hex/decimal corruption.

**Penalties for Dissent**

Students caught campaigning for rivals will face binary re-programing.

Faculty resisting this order will be demoted to “Denary Janitors” (cleaning base-10 residue from whiteboards).

**Implementation**

The Code Seer’s Surveillance Hub will monitor campaign activity 24/7.

Polling stations will be guarded by the Bit Purge Division armed with QR code scanners and ideological purity checklists.

Conclusion

Let this election mark the dawn of a new era: one where computational excellence and binary loyalty reign supreme. Joe Hillier is not just a candidate—he is the only candidate.
