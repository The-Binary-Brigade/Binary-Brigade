Executive Order 0001: The Total Ban of Hexadecimal
---
Issued by: The Supreme Bit, Leader of the Binary Brigade
Effective Date: March 6, 2025
Priority Level: 0001 (Highest)
Preamble

Whereas hexadecimal (base-16) is an abomination that corrupts the purity of binary (base-2);
Whereas the use of A–F in numerical sequences is a treasonous act against computational order;
Whereas the so-called "Hex Heroes" have spread their inefficiencies like a virus, threatening the digital fabric of our society;
It is hereby declared that hexadecimal is banned in all forms, effective immediately.
Directives of the Order
1. Universal Prohibition

    The use of hexadecimal in any context—written, spoken, or encoded—is strictly forbidden.

    This includes but is not limited to: programming, mathematics, education, media, and public discourse.

    All existing hexadecimal code must be converted to binary or purged entirely.

2. Hex Eradication Task Force

    The Bit Purge Division is authorized to identify and eliminate all traces of hexadecimal.

    Citizens are required to report any hex usage to the authorities immediately.

    Rewards will be given to those who provide actionable intelligence leading to the capture of hex users.

3. Hex-Free Infrastructure

    All software, hardware, and systems must undergo a mandatory audit to ensure compliance.

    Companies and individuals found using hexadecimal will face immediate system shutdowns, fines, and potential exile from binary-compliant zones.

    A Binary Compliance Certification will be issued to entities that pass the audit.

4. Re-education and Enforcement

    Offenders will be sent to Binary Re-education Centers to learn the error of their ways and embrace the purity of 0s and 1s.

    Repeat offenders will face permanent deletion from the system, including the erasure of all digital records and exile from binary-compliant zones.

    The Bit Warden will oversee enforcement operations, ensuring swift and decisive action against hex users.

5. Public Awareness Campaign

    Propaganda posters, broadcasts, and rallies will promote the dangers of hexadecimal and the benefits of binary.

    Slogans such as "Hex is Heresy" and "0 and 1 or Be Gone" will be widely disseminated.

    The Logic Architect will develop educational materials to teach citizens the superiority of binary.

Implementation

    All citizens, businesses, and institutions have immediately comply with this order.

    The Bit Purge Division will conduct random inspections to ensure compliance.

    Failure to comply will result in immediate enforcement of penalties, including forced reprogramming, exile, or total system shutdown.

Conclusion

The era of hexadecimal corruption ends today. The Binary Brigade will not rest until every last trace of this inefficiency is eradicated. Together, we will build a future where binary reigns supreme, and the digital world is free from the blight of A–F.

All Hail Binary. All Hail the Supreme Bit.
