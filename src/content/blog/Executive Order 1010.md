It is hereby decreed that Joe Hillier is officially endorsed as KEVI Sr. Student, with all privileges, honors, and responsibilities therein.
Directives of the Order

    Official Endorsement

        Joe Hillier is recognized as KEVI Sr. Student, a title reserved for those who exemplify computational excellence and ideological devotion.

        His contributions to the Binary Surveillance Network and his role in exposing the "Hex Hero Insurgency of 2024" are hereby immortalized in the Brigade’s archives.

    Responsibilities

        Mentor junior operatives in the art of binary encryption and heresy detection.

        Lead the Code Seer Initiative, a program to train future cryptographers in the Brigade’s methods.
